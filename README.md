# jscodereview

The goal of this project is to provide a forum for learners to receive feedback on their JavaScript code. It was created based on a belief that receiving, incorporating, and responding to feedback is a key part of gaining experience as a software developer.

This README outlines the guidelines for participating in this project, both for reviews and for people submitting code for review.

This project adheres to the [Node code of conduct](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you have questions or concerns, or need to report a code of conduct violation, please [email me](mailto:rmurphey@gmail.com).

## Guidelines for seeking code review

- Code reviews are only provided for public repositories.
- Code reviews are only provided for pull requests; at this time, this project does not provide reviews of projects as a whole.
- Your [pull request description](./docs/pull-request.md) should, *at a minimum*, provide:
  - A brief description of the problem being solved
  - A brief summary of the solution included in the pull request
  - Clear steps for the reviewer to see the code in action
  - A brief discussion covering:
    - how you chose your approach
    - links to reference material you used
    - alternative approaches you considered
    - any questions you have about your approach
- Once a reviewer indicates they have started reviewing your pull request, feel free to reach out to them directly on the jscodereview Slack.

To request a review, post a link to your pull request in one or more relevant channels in the jscodereview Slack.

## Guidelines for providing code review

- When you begin a review, reach out to the submitter on the jscodereview Slack to let them know.
- **Be nice.** If you are not nice you will be asked not to provide future reviews.
- [Read this](https://storify.com/ReBeccaOrg/rebecca-s-rules-for-constructive-code-reviews).
- Focus on providing guidance, not instructions.
